This repository has all basic data structure and algorithm codes ranging from simple 1-d array to basic searching, sorting and traversal algorithms. 3 directories are created: 1) 1dArrays-which has all codes of traversal, insertion and deletion of data from a 1 dimensional array. 2) 2dArrays- will have all codes of traversal, insertion and deletion of data from a 2 dimensional array. 3) linkedList- will have all codes related to linkedList.
